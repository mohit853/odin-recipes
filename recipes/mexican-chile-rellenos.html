      The chile relleno is a dish in Mexican cuisine that originated in the city
      of Puebla. In 1858, it was described as a "green chile pepper stuffed with
      minced meat and coated with eggs". The most common pepper used is Puebla's
      poblano pepper, though New Mexico chile, pasilla, or even jalapeño peppers
      are popular as well. It is typically stuffed with melted cheese, such as
      queso Chihuahua or queso Oaxaca or with picadillo meat made of diced pork,
      raisins and nuts, seasoned with canella; covered in an egg white batter,
      simply corn masa flour and fried, or without any batter at all.[2][3]
      Although it is often served in a tomato sauce, the sauces can vary.

    <h1>Ingridents</h1>
    <ul style="list-style-type: square">
      <li>6 fresh Anaheim chile peppers</li>
      <li>
        1 (8 ounce) package queso asadero (white Mexican cheese), cut into
        3/4-inch thick strips
      </li>
      <li>2 large eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable shortening for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman">
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven broiler; set the oven rack about 6 inches below the
        heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place peppers onto the prepared baking sheet and broil until skins are
        blackened and blistered, about 10 minutes. Use tongs to rotate peppers
        often to char all sides. Place blackened peppers into a bowl and tightly
        seal with plastic wrap. Allow peppers to steam as they cool, about 15
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove skin from peppers, then cut a slit down the long side of each one
        to remove seeds and core.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse peppers inside and our and pat dry with paper towels. Stuff
        peppers with strips of cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Whisk egg yolks and baking powder in a bowl until combined.</li>
      <li>
        Beat egg whites with an electric mixer in a separate bowl until stiff
        peaks form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gently fold beaten whites into the yolk mixture. Place flour into a
        separate shallow bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
