      How to Make Homemade Lasagna Making homemade lasagna much easier than it
      looks. You'll find the flil, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a
      brief overview of what you can expect: 1. Cook the meat: Cook the ground
      meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue
      cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half
      of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.
      2. Cook the noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water
      until they're al dente. 3. Make the cheese layer: Mix cottage cheese,
      Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and
      pepper in a bowl. 4. Assemble the lasagna: Layer the ingredients according
      to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the
      lasagna is assembled. 5. Bake the lasagna: Cover with foil and bake in the
      preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking
      until the top is gliden brown.
