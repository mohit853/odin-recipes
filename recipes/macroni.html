    <p>
      Macaroni and cheese (also known as mac and cheese in Canada and the United
      States and macaroni cheese in the United Kingdom) is a dish of macaroni
      pasta and a cheese sauce, most commonly cheddar sauce. Its origins trace
      back to cheese and pasta casseroles dating to the 14th century in Italy
      and medieval England. The traditional macaroni and cheese is put in a
      casserole and baked in the oven; however, it may be prepared in a sauce
      pan on top of the stove or using a packaged mix. The cheese is often first
      incorporated into a Béchamel sauce to create a Mornay sauce, which is then
      added to the pasta. In the United States and Canada, it is considered a
      comfort food by many.
